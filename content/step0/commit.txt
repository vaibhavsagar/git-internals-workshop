You are in a maze of twisty little objects, all alike.

All the information that constitutes a git repository is stored under `.git`.
In this workshop, we'll go through some of this information with the aim of
understanding how git works under the hood.

Exercise 1: run `cat .git/HEAD`

HEAD is a 'symbolic ref' that references the latest commit of the current
branch. It's a pointer to a pointer, which can get a little confusing.

Exercise 2: run `cat .git/refs/heads/master`

This is what HEAD currently points to. It stores an object reference as a SHA1
hash, which is what `git` uses to keep track of content.

Exercise 3: inspect `tools/resolve_ref.py` or `tools/ResolveRef.hs`

This script resolves both symbolic and regular git refs and returns the SHA1
hash of an object.

Exercise 4: run `python3 tools/resolve_ref.py HEAD` or `stack tools/ResolveRef.hs HEAD`

This should give us the output from Exercise 2.

Finally: run `git checkout step1` and `git cat-file -p HEAD`
