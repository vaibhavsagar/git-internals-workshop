'Tis but a scratch!

You should have gotten a warning about being in a 'detached HEAD' state. This
means that HEAD is no longer pointing to the most current commit of a branch.
You can verify this by looking at the contents of `.git/HEAD` but for the
purposes of this workshop we can safely ignore this warning.

Exercise 1: run `git cat-file -p HEAD`

You should see this same content. `git cat-file -p` is a git 'plumbing' command
(contrasted to a 'porcelain' command like `git status`, think of a toilet) that
will take a symbolic ref, a normal ref, or the unambiguous prefix of an object
reference and pretty print the object content (hence the '-p')

A commit consists of:

1. A tree (representing the root directory of a project)
2. Some parent commits (the initial commit has no parents and merge commits can
   have two or more parents, but most commits have one parent)
3. An author
4. A committer
5. A message

Exercise 2: inspect the contents of `tools/show_object.py` or
`tools/ShowObject.hs` and the updated `tools/resolve_ref.py` or
`tools/ResolveRef.hs`

`git` stores its data as zlib-compressed files in the `.git/objects`
directory as follows:
1. Get the SHA1 hash of some content.
2. zlib-compress the content.
2. Take the first 2 characters of this hash. This is the directory under
   `.git/objects` where git will store the zlib-compressed content.
3. The next 38 characters are the filename of the zlib-compressed file.

You can verify this by running `tree .git/objects` if you have `tree`.

Exercise 3: run `python3 tools/show_object.py HEAD` or `stack
tools/ShowObject.hs HEAD`

This should be recognisably similar to the output of Exercise 1. With a commit
it would be simple to `.decode()` the output and get something that looks
almost exactly like our earlier output but there's a good reason we're not
doing this which I'll talk about in the next step.

Finally: run `git checkout step2` and `git cat-file -p HEAD`
